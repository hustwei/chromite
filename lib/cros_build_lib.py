      shell must be false.
    print_cmd: prints the command before running it.
    error_ok: ***DEPRECATED, use error_code_ok instead***
              Does not raise an exception on any errors.
    error_message: prints out this message when an error occurs.
    redirect_stdout: returns the stdout.
    redirect_stderr: holds stderr output until input is communicated.
    cwd: the working directory to run this cmd.
    input: input to pipe into this command through stdin.
    enter_chroot: this command should be run from within the chroot.  If set,
      cwd must point to the scripts directory.
    shell: Controls whether we add a shell as a command interpreter.  See cmd
      since it has to agree as to the type.
    env: If non-None, this is the environment for the new process.  If
      enter_chroot is true then this is the environment of the enter_chroot,
      most of which gets removed from the cmd run.
    extra_env: If set, this is added to the environment for the new process.
      In enter_chroot=True case, these are specified on the post-entry
      side, and so are often more useful.  This dictionary is not used to
      clear any entries though.
    ignore_sigint: If True, we'll ignore signal.SIGINT before calling the
      child.  This is the desired behavior if we know our child will handle
      Ctrl-C.  If we don't do this, I think we and the child will both get
      Ctrl-C at the same time, which means we'll forcefully kill the child.
    combine_stdout_stderr: Combines stdout and stderr streams into stdout.
    log_stdout_to_file: If set, redirects stdout to file specified by this path.
      If combine_stdout_stderr is set to True, then stderr will also be logged
      to the specified file.
    chroot_args: An array of arguments for the chroot environment wrapper.
    debug_level: The debug level of RunCommand's output - applies to output
                 coming from subprocess as well.
    error_code_ok: Does not raise an exception when command returns a non-zero
                   exit code.  Instead, returns the CommandResult object
                   containing the exit code.
    kill_timeout: If we're interrupted, how long should we give the invoked
                  process to shutdown from a SIGTERM before we SIGKILL it.
                  Specified in seconds.
